# TempDrop - Desktop Widget

## What is TempDrop?

TempDrop is a desktop widget that solves a common problem: you have files you need temporarily but want easy access to, so you put them on your desktop. But then they stay there forever, creating clutter.

TempDrop gives you a transparent window on your desktop where you can store these temporary files. They automatically get deleted after a few days, keeping your desktop clean.

## How It Works

### The Widget
- A semi-transparent window appears on your desktop
- It stays behind other windows - only visible when you're on the desktop
- You can drag it anywhere on your desktop
- You can resize it to fit more or fewer files
- It doesn't appear in your taskbar or Alt-Tab list - it's just part of your desktop

### Adding Files
- **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag any file from your computer into the TempDrop window
- **Auto-Detection**: If you save files directly to the TempDrop folder, they automatically appear in the widget
- **Manual Add**: Click a button to browse and add files

### File Display
Files appear as desktop shortcuts/icons (not a boring file list):
- Each file shows with its proper icon (PDFs look like PDFs, images look like images, etc.)
- Files are arranged in a grid like desktop shortcuts
- You can see file names clearly
- Right-click any file for options (open, delete, properties)

### Managing Files
- **Open**: Double-click any file to open it with its default program
- **Delete**: Right-click and select "Delete" or use the trash icon
- **Properties**: Right-click to see file details
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Files automatically disappear after the number of days you set (default: 7 days)

### Widget Controls
- **Move**: Drag the title bar to move the widget around
- **Resize**: Drag the corners to make it bigger or smaller
- **Close**: Click the X button to close the widget
- **Settings**: Click the gear icon to change auto-deletion time, storage folder, etc.
- **Open Folder**: Click the folder icon to open the TempDrop storage folder directly

### Settings
- **Auto-deletion**: Set how many days before files are automatically deleted (1-30 days)
- **Storage Location**: Choose where files are stored (default: your Documents folder)
- **Transparency**: Adjust how transparent the widget appears
- **Start with Windows**: Option to start TempDrop automatically when you boot up

## User Experience Flow

2. **Add Files**: Drag files into the window or save them to the TempDrop folder

4. **Use Files**: Double-click to open, right-click for more options
5. **Auto-Cleanup**: Files automatically disappear after your set time period

## What Makes It Special

- **Desktop Widget**: It's not a regular app - it's part of your desktop
- **Visual**: Files look like desktop shortcuts, not a boring list
- **Automatic**: Set it and forget it - files clean themselves up
- **Flexible**: Move it, resize it, configure it however you want
- **Non-Intrusive**: Semi-transparent so it doesn't block your desktop

## Common Use Cases

- **Downloads**: Drag downloaded files here instead of leaving them on desktop
- **Screenshots**: Save screenshots here for temporary reference
- **Documents**: Store work-in-progress files that you'll delete later
- **Media**: Keep temporary images, videos, or audio files
